# How does Car Loan EMI Calculators work?

You can calculate the Car Loan EMI Amount with the help of the mathematical formula: EMI Amount = [P x R x (1+R)^N]/[(1+R)^N-1] , where P, R, and N are the variables. This also means that the EMI value will change, each time you change any of the three variables. Let&#39;s discuss these three variables in detail.

- &#39;P&#39; stands for the Principal Amount. It is the original loan amount given to you by the bank on which the interest will be calculated.
- &#39;R&#39; stands for the Rate of Interest set by the bank.
- N is the number of years given for the repayment of the loan. As you must pay the EMIs each month, the duration is calculated in the number of months.

So, if you take a car loan of Rs 10 lakh at an interest rate of 12%, the approximate EMI will be: P = Rs 10,00,000, R = 12/100/12 (You must convert into months), N = 2 years or 24 months. EMI = [10,00,000 x 12/100/12 x (1+12/100/12)^24] / [(1+12/100/12)^24-1] EMI = Rs 47,073.
